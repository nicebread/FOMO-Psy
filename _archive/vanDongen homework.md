Read van Dongen et al. (2022). Improving psychological explanations. *PsyArXiv.* [https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qd69g](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/qd69g) and answer the following guiding questions:

1. What is the role an original authors should play when predictions are derived from a theory?

<!-- Answer: None. -->

2. Are phenomena, according to Bogen and Woodward, directly observable?

<!-- Answer: No. Although they are *established* by evidence from observations, they transcend any particular set of structured or unstructured data. -->

3. What is the role of statistical patterns in the Productive Explanation Model?

<!-- Answer: Statistical patterns are abstractions and generalizations of concrete structured data. They represent phenomena (i.e., they are their empirical anchor) and are produced by formal models. -->

4. List the three steps of productive explanation.

<!-- Answer: 
- Step 1: Represent the phenomenon as a statistical pattern.
- Step 2: Explicate the verbal theory as a formal model.
- Step 3: Evaluate whether the formal model produces the statistical pattern.
 -->

5. Does Model 3 of the Regulatory Resource Theory explain the ego-depletion effect?

<!-- Answer: 
With the specifically chosen parameters: Yes. But it "depends on a quite delicate balance between parameters that characterize the interplay between task demand and willpower." 
 -->

6. Not every explanation has the same quality. Describe the three quality criteria provided in the paper in one or two sentences each.

<!-- Answer:
Precision: Precise theories already specify many aspects of the formal model. Hence the set of formal models that are consistent with the verbal theory is relatively small.

Robustness: assess the impact of auxiliary assumptions that are necessary to specify a formal model but are not specified by the theory.

Empirical relevance:
