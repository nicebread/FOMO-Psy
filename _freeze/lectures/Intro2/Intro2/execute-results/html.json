It serves as a bridge between abstract theoretical principles and the empirical world.\n\nSometimes a theory is so highly formalized that it is virtually [identical]{.alert} to a model of it. But more often, there is a [gap]{.hl} between theory and implemented models: We need more assumptions to implement a model in computer code. In this case, multiple models can satisfy the axioms and constraints of a theory.\n\n\n## Explicating a verbal theory into formal model(s)\n### Example: van Dongen et al (2023) on Ego Depletion\n\n::: {.smaller}\n- The regulatory resource theory pertains to **self-control**: cognitive processes that inhibit and suppress immediate thoughts, impulses, expression of emotions, and behaviors that deviate from standards or goals. \n- The theory postulates that one’s ability for self-control depends on a **finite resource**: a stored supply of energy, for which some use the term willpower. Every act of self-control reduces the amount of willpower, so that one’s ability to inhibit or suppress the next unwanted impulse is diminished\n- The theory is said to explain the **phenomenon of ego depletion**: people perform worse on a task that requires self-control, right after having done something else that used this resource.\n:::\n\n::: footer\nAbridged from van Dongen et al.

Their values are based on previous research, theory, or external information (such as properties of the world).\n- **Free parameters**: Can be adjusted to optimize the fit of the model to data. They are *estimated* from empirical data.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nVirtually all parameters (except natural constants) could be imagined as being free.
