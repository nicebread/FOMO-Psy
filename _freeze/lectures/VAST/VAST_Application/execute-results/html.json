This slide set covers steps 2 to 6 of the broader scheme. \n:::\n\n\n## Step 1: Choose your starting point\n\nFormalization approaches can differ in their *starting point* (which often are not clear-cut distinct):\n\n- (A) **Start with an existing verbal theory**, formalize it as it is.\n  - Interpret the verbal statements, make them more precise, visualize as a VAST display\n  - Ignore empirical evidence (even if a hypothesized effect has already been empirically rejected, keep it in the model)\n  - Do not fix inconsistencies, do not improve the theory: We want to make explicit what the original authors had in mind with their theory.\n- (B) **Start with robust phenomena (TCM approach)**, invent an explanatory theory and formal model\n  - Ignore existing verbal theories (which might be hard once you know them)\n  - This will (potentially) lead to an alternative theory/model to the existing theory\n\n## Step 1: Choose your starting point\n### A-B Mixture Model (for formalization attempts)\n\n- Starting point is an existing narrative theory\n- We soon will detect inconsistencies. For successfully modelling the theory, we have to *resolve* them, e.g. by:\n  - Deciding on one specific construct definition\n  - Synthesizing multiple definitions\n  - Only use robust phenomena as explanatory targets\n  - Select only components of the theory that are theoretically central to explain your explanatory target.\n- The result will be a *reduced* and *refined* theory, that is inspired by the original theory but not identical to it.\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Limit your scope\n\nMost theories in psychology are too fuzzy and broad to be formalized in one round. We restrict the scope of the theory to keep modelling feasible:\n\n- Define the **scope of original literature** that is used as basis for the formalization.\n- Limit the number of **phenomena** that your model is supposed to explain. Focus on phenomena that are empirically robust.\n- Limit the number of **constructs** and their **relationships**, add complexity later.\n  - Start with the smallest number of constructs necessary to explain your explanatory target. \n  - Maybe exclude entire sections of a theory.\n  - What is your focal outcome variable (DV)? What are the focal predictors or interventions?\n\n\n# Step 3: What is the explanatory target? Collect robust empirical phenomena {background-color=\"#40666e\"}\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n\nRobustness of phenomena has two dimensions:\n \n1. **Generalizability** (cf. [UTOS framework](../lectures/Intro1/FOMO-Psy_1_Theory_crisis#the-relation-of-data-and-phenomena-2)): The effect has been shown for different [U]{.hl}nits, with different operationalizations of [T]{.hl}reatments and [O]{.hl}utcomes, and in multiple [S]{.hl}ettings.\n2. Strong empirical **evidence** for each/many of the generalizations.\n\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n\nPractically, you should do the following steps to assess these two dimensions:\n\n1. Search for **meta-analyses** that report on phenomena with our focal variables\n   &rarr; Only if no meta-analysis is available, or it is not helpful: Do a broader literature search for primary studies.\n2. Assess the robustness of the phenomena along the two dimensions:   \n   1. How *generalizable* is it? Go through all four UTOS dimensions and evaluate which types of generalization have been shown across studies.\n   2. How *strong* is the evidence? (e.g., based on number *k* of studies in a meta-analysis, strength of evidence, risk of bias)\n3. Write a paragraph that makes an overall assessment of the robustness of each phenomenon and gives a clear and explicit answer: \"The phenomenon can (not) be considered robust because, ...\". Refer to the two dimensions of robustness and give references that back up your claim.\n\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n### How to jointly assess \"strength of evidence\" and \"generalizability\"\n\n::: {.smaller}\nWhen you assess the generalizability, you should distinguish **three prototypical epistemic states**:\n\n- \"I know that it is generalizable.\" &rarr; strong evidence for $H_1$\n- \"I know that it is *not* generalizable.\" &rarr; strong evidence for $H_0$\n- \"I *do not know* whether it is generalizable or not - with the given empirical evidence I cannot answer this question.\"  &rarr; inconclusive evidence\n\nWhen is the strength of evidence strong? If ...\n\n- you have many studies,\n- which are methodologically sound (i.e., valid),\n- and show (at least in sum) a decisive statistical result into either direction (i.e., either for a difference, or for a null effect)\n\n:::\n\n::: footer\nAs a sidenote: Ideally, evidence is quantified with a statistical technique that also allows to measure evidence *for* the null hypothesis and that gives a continuous quantification of the strength of evidence. A Bayes factor provides both desiderata.\n:::\n\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width='60%'}\n![Figure 1: Possible results of a generalizability assessment.](img/Generalizability_space.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nGeneral principle: We can only make statements about stuff that we actually studied.\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width='40%' .smallest}\nWe describe six prototypical examples:\n\n- **(A)**: strong evidence that the phenomenon **is not** generalizable.\n- **(B)**: strong evidence that the phenomenon **is** generalizable - at least within the space of sampled variations.\n- **(C)**: weak evidence that the phenomenon **is not** generalizable.\n- **(D)**: weak evidence that the phenomenon **is** generalizable. As we don't know about the untested variations, the evidence principally cannot be very strong. \n- **(E)**: principally unknowable whether the result generalizes to other variations. We can only conclude that we cannot conclude anything about generalizability.\n- **(F)**: evidence is **inconclusive.** There are descriptive differences between variations, but they are small, and it is not clear if these differences are statistically significant and substantial.\n\n:::\n::::\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n### {{< fa people-group size=1x >}} Exercise (5 min)\n\nAll four UTOS dimensions can get an independent assessment. Consider the [ManyLabs2 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245918810225), where identical experiment (except translation of materials) has been administered online in very diverse samples (at least diverse with respect to nationality and cultural background). \n\nNon-zero effects could be found with remarkably low variability across samples. Quoted from the abstract: \n\n> \"Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied\".\n\n**Evaluate the generalizability of the reported effects along the four UTOS dimensions.**\n\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n### Applying the heuristic to ManyLabs2\n\n![Figure 2: A generalizability assessment of the UTOS dimensions in ManyLabs 2.](img/Generalizability_space_ML2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=75%}\n\n::: {.smaller}\nHence, we have strong evidence for high generalizability for the U and the S dimension, but we cannot make a conclusion concerning the T and the O dimensions, as they lacked the necessary variation in the study.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena\n### Example: Social Loafing (adapted from Emilia Wittig)\n\n::: {.smallest}\n\"A meta-analysis of 78 studies underlines that social loafing is a robust phenomenon that generalizes across tasks and populations (Karau & Williams, 1993). \n\nRegarding different **units**, social loating was found among groups of organizational employees, college students as well as high school students. Furthermore, the phenomenon appears within different genders as well as various cultures. \n\nThe studies mentioned in the meta-analysis used a variety of different tasks as **treatment**, such as physical exercises (e.g., rope pulling), cognitive tasks (e.g., brainstorming), evaluative efforts (e.g., rating items) and perceptual tasks (e.g., monitoring a screen for signals). These tasks also differed in complexity. \n\nRegarding the **outcomes**, social loafing was generally assessed by comparing individual's coactive efforts with the individual's collective efforts. The specific units of measurement varied across tasks, with some studies focusing on quantity of individual contributions and others taking the quality into account. \n\nLastly, concerning different **settings** of studies, the meta analysis included laboratory studies as well as field studies. \n\n[In sum, we can conclude that evidence for social loafing found in this meta-analytic review is strong and the phenomenon generalizes over all of the UTOS dimensions. Social Loafing can be consider to be a robust phenomenon.]{.hl}\"\n:::\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Collect definitions of constructs\n### Construct Source Table\n\n::: {.smallest}\n- Collect quotes of definitions of constructs and their relationships from the literature. \n- Make them atomic (i.e., split up long quotes into their basic components).\n- Assign a unique ID to each statement.\n\nThis table will be called the *[Construct Source Table]{.hl}*, as it collects the original sources for the definitions of the constructs.\n\n<div class=\"table-grid\">\n| ID  | Type | Short name       | Quote                                                                                                                                                             | Reference                     | rel. type (n, p, i, r, ...) | Comment | Incl.

Example: \n  - Latent property: The caloric energy of a dessert\n  - Cues: Size, taste, color\n- Cues often are not perfect indicators, but rather statistically correlated with the criterion. \n<br>Higher correlation &rarr; higher [cue validity]{.bg style='--col: #fff100'}\n- Not all cues are used (with the same weight) in judgement formation &rarr; [cue utilization]{.bg style='--col: #fff100'}\n:::\n\n::: footer\nBrunswik, E.
