    "text": "Interlude: The risky shift phenomenon 2\n Questions for discussion (10 min.):\n\nAnalyse the situation in the UTOS dimensions (units, treatments, outcomes, settings): To which dimensions did the successful replications (not) refer to?\nIs the “risky shift” effect - as demonstrated in the early publications - a phenomenon?\n\n\nMy take: It is a phenomenon (though a weak one), as it generalizes to new units (i.e., new participants) of the same operationalization. But the generalizability was much weaker than initially expected. It is a phenomenon of this specific stimulus set (outcome operationalization) and suggests certain types of research questions (e.g., “What is so specific to this stimulus set?”)."

Most of the replication studies […] employed the CDQ [Choice Dilemma Questionnaire] as their stimulus set, and they generally had no trouble obtaining the basic risky shift result.”\nToday we know that there is no risky shift. “It is now clear that the items contained in the original CDQ are in no sense a representative sample of the universe of all possible items. Instruments similar to the CDQ could readily be constructed whose scores would display risky shifts, cautious ones, or none at all” (Cartwright, 1971, p. 368).\nIn the early risky shift literature, theoretical progress was unnecessarily impeded by multiple generations of replication studies (k ⋍ 200), nearly all relying on the same CQD questionnaire.\n\n\n\n\nSee Westfall et al. (2015).

    "text": "This is the email I sent to the colleagues in my department:\n\nSubject: We formalize your theory!\n\nBody:\nDear colleagues,\nthis semester, we want to explore something new. In my upcoming Empra (for 5th semester students), the participants get acquainted with formal modeling of psychological theories. The goal is to develop a mathematical or agent-based model of a verbal theory. In this project, …\n\nthe central phenomena are listed (What is to be explained?)\nthe verbal theory is explicated, and\na theory formalization is attempted (in a way that data can be simulated from the model).\n\nWe wanted to ask you - the colleagues in the department - if you want to submit a theory for this exercise.\nHere are some FAQs:\n\nWhat theory would be a good fit?\n\nA theory that is sufficiently precise and has a defined and not too large scope\nIts core premises are formulated in a clear and concise form on a few pages.\nThere doesn’t exist a formalized theory yet (e.g., it would be hard to re-create decades of theory building on the drift-diffusion model within a single course).\n\n\n\nWhat theory would not be a good fit?\n\nYou need to read three books to understand the theory.\nThe “all-encompassing theory of human nature”\nYou need a lot of expert input and judgement to fill in the gaps of the underspecified theory.\nYou need very specific domain knowledge to even understand the basic phenomena and constructs of the theory.\n\n\n\nBut don’t the students lack domain knowledge?\nIn an ideal world, theories are so well specified that they can be formalized without further expert opinions. But as this is unrealistic in psychology, we need your input (see next question).\n\n\nWhat is my necessary commitment?\n\nProvide the written material for the theory.\nTwo or three meetings (each lasting ~2h) during the Empra’s teaching hours (XXX):\n\nMeeting 1 where you give a short overview of the theory. It should contain the following aspects:\n\nWhat is the central phenomenon that is aimed to be explained?\nHow does a typical study look like that produces the phenomenon?\n\nAn introduction to the theory that aims to explain the phenomenon.\n\nWhat is the central literature? (To get an impression of how the narrative theory is presented.)\n\nMeeting 2 where students present intermediate results and can ask questions for clarification.\n(optional) Meeting 3, where students present their results to you.\nIf you enjoy and benefit from the scientific discussion, of course more meetings are possible and welcome.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens with the results?\nThe created models will be published with a CC-BY license. That means, you can reuse everything with a proper citation. If the models are really helpful (and more than just a vague inspiration for further work), we can think about a follow-up collaboration and write-up (where collaboration and co-authorship is offered to the student creators of the model).\n\n\nThe procedure would be as follows:\n\nWe collect candidate theories for formalization until 30.10.2023.\nWe screen all submissions and select one or two theories (depending on their complexity).\nIf your theory is selected, we will meet:\n\nFor the introductory meeting (xx.xx.2023, ~2h)\nFor the intermediate meeting (xx.xx.2024, ~2h)\nFor the results presentation (xx.xx.2024, ~2h)\n\n\nIf you want to participate, please send an email to xxx by xx.xx.2023, containing a short description of the theory (max. 200 words) and a link to a central paper describing the theory. It can be “your” theory, or an existing theory that you work with.\nA final caveat: We are aware that this collaboration requires a non-negligible time investment from you. At the same time, this is highly experimental and we cannot promise any success or even progress. But in any case we expect good scientific discussions and are convinced that the exercise is fruitful for all parties.\nIf you have any questions, drop me an email.\n\nHere are some (anonymized) reactions I got:\n\n“EPIC!”\n“A very good idea. Just trying it would fulfil my heart’s desire”\n\nAt the end, 3 theories got submitted. We discussed them and selected 1 of them, mostly based on feasibility and personal interest. (Formalizing more than 1 theory would have been impossible in the time frame of the course)."

    "text": "Im Empirisch-psychologischen Praktikum “Formale Modellierung in der Psychologie” tauchen die Studierenden in die Welt der quantitativen Darstellung psychologischer Theorien ein. Dabei geht es nicht um die quantitative Auswertung von Daten mit Hilfe statistischer Modelle, sondern um Theorien und datengenerierende Modelle, die so präzise sind, dass man konkrete Daten vorhersagen kann.\nAls eine Reaktion auf die Replikationskrise wurde der Ruf nach besseren Theorien laut, mit dem Ziel, verbale und konzeptionelle Theorien in formale, mathematische Modelle zu übersetzen. Diese Modelle dienen mehreren Zwecken: Sie ermöglichen eine rigorose Prüfung von Hypothesen, bieten klarere Vorhersagen und bilden einen Rahmen, um scheinbar disparate Ergebnisse zu vereinheitlichen. Außerdem schärfen sie den Blick auf “Leerstellen” in den meist hoffnungslos unterspezifizierten Theorien in der Psychologie.\nIn diesem Kurs werden die Studierenden in die grundlegenden Prinzipien der formalen Modellierung und ihre verschiedenen Varianten eingeführt (z.B. mathematische Modelle, Regelkreismodelle, agentenbasierte Modelle) und mit den Werkzeugen ausgestattet, die sie benötigen, um aus vorhandenen verbalen Theorien Modelle abzuleiten. Entsprechend werden wir uns viel mit der Implementierung in Programmiersprachen befassen. Wir werden dabei vermutlich viel in R programmieren, ggf. auch in NetLogo (für ABMs).\nWir werden versuchen, kollaborativ verbale psychologische Theorien soweit zu formalisieren, dass man sie in ein datengenerierendes Modell übersetzen und implementieren kann, um die generierten Daten dann zur Prüfung mit echten Daten zu vergleichen.\nWir werden Aspekte der Qualitätssicherung bei diesem Forschungsaspekt diskutieren und anwenden (Reproduzierbarkeit, Versionskontrolle, Sensitivitätsanalysen, gut dokumentierter Code / unit testing).\nDas Empra stellt etwas höhere Anforderungen an mathematisches und formales Denken, sowie ihre Programmierfähigkeit. Als Minimum werden die R-Kenntnisse vorausgesetzt, die im Rahmen der Seminare zu Statistik 1 und 2 gelehrt wurden, sowie die Bereitschaft, sich auch selbständig (anhand von bereitgestelltem Material) in Themen der Programmierung einzuarbeiten."

Hier kommen einige Hinweise für den Start:\n\nIch würde gerne den Start von 8:15 auf 8:30 verlegen. Die Sitzung geht dann in der Regel bis 12:00.\nWir werden in fast jeder Sitzung am Computer arbeiten - z.B. Code schreiben, Diagramme zeichnen, oder Dateien in git einchecken. Daher wäre es gut, wenn Sie, wenn möglich, immer ihren Laptop mitbringen. Wenn Sie keinen Laptop haben, können Sie auch bei Kommilitonen reinschauen und im “pair programming” Modus arbeiten.\nWenn das letzte Programmieren in R schon etwas länger her ist, frischen Sie gerne vorab Ihre Kenntnisse auf. Das Empra wird keine Auffrischung in R beinhalten. Hier sind einige Ressourcen:\n\nDie neuen R-Tutorials aus Statistik 1: Teil 1 - Grundlagen und Teil 2 - Workflows bei der Arbeit mit Datensätzen\nMoodle Kurs “R Tutorials”. Am Lehrstuhl Sozialpsychologie wurden R-Tutorials (Skript englisch, begleitende Videos deutsch) erstellt. Die Tutorials helfen, einen Anfang in R zu finden und zeigen die Durchführung ein paar üblicher Schritte der Datenaufbereitung und -auswertung. Passwort für den Moodle-Kurs: allyouneedisR\nYouTube-Video: “Want to learn R (#rstats) in 4 hours with NO programming experience?”\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf (12 page PDF document)\nhttps://github.com/jobreu/r-intro-gesis-2021 (5 day course: slides & exercises)\n\nDas bedeutet nicht, dass Sie all diese Ressourcen durcharbeiten müssen. Wenn Sie auf dem Stand der beiden R-Tutorials (siehe 3.1) sind, sind Sie hinreichend vorbereitet.\nDie Kommunikation wird ab jetzt über den Moodle-Kurs laufen. Der Einschreibeschlüssel lautet: “theorie”. Bitte schreiben Sie sich schon zeitnah ein; ich verschicke ab jetzt die Emails über den Kurs.\nDas Kursmaterial wird sich alles auf Github finden: https://nicebread.github.io/FOMO-Psy/. Im Moment befindet sich dort noch das alte Material; ich baue das gerade substantiell um. Aber dann haben Sie schon mal den Link.\n\nDann sehen wir uns am Freitag, 18.10.24, um 8:30 in Raum 1407 zur ersten Sitzung! Bei Fragen können Sie sich gerne auch vorab schon bei mir melden.\nViele Grüße, Felix Schönbrodt"

But it’s a skill that will pay off in the long run. If you get stuck, and made honest attempts to solve the problems yourself, don’t get desperate: Just send me your homework via email, and we will sort it out together in the next session.\n\n\nHomework 3 (individually): Read the VAST paper\nRead the VAST paper:\nLeising, D., Grenke, O., & Cramer, M. (2023). Visual Argument Structure Tool (VAST) Version 1.0. Meta-Psychology, 7. https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/2911\nDeliverable: Nothing - just read it and understand it.\n\n\nHomework 4 (individually): Your first (mini) VAST display\nThis homework consists of three steps, A, B, and C:\n\nRead the original definition of the concept “diffusion of responsibility”, printed below. Darley and Latané introduced the term in 1968, it’s even in the title of the publication: “Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility.”\n\nThese are the paragraphs that describe the concept (p. 377f):\n\n[After introducing the case of Kitty Genovese:] “In certain circumstances, the norms favoring intervention may be weakened, leading bystanders to resolve the conflict in the direction of nonintervention. One of these circumstances may be the presence of other onlookers. For example, in the case above, each observer, by seeing lights and figures in other apartment house windows, knew that others were also watching. However, there was no way to tell how the other observers were reacting. These two facts provide several reasons why any individual may have delayed or failed to help. The responsibility for helping was diffused among the observers; there was also diffusion of any potential blame for not taking action; and finally, it was possible that somebody, unperceived, had already initiated helping action.\nWhen only one bystander is present in an emergency, if help is to come, it must come from him. Although he may choose to ignore it (out of concern for his personal safety, or desires “not to get involved”), any pressure to intervene focuses uniquely on him. When there are several observers present, however, the pressures to intervene do not focus on any one of the observers; instead the responsibility for intervention is shared among all the onlookers and is not unique to any one. As a result, no one helps.\nA second possibility is that potential blame may be diffused. However much we may wish to think that an individual’s moral behavior is divorced from considerations of personal punishment or reward, there is both theory and evidence to the contrary (Aronfreed, 1964; Miller & Bollard, 1941, Whiting & Child, 19S3). It is perfectly reasonable to assume that, under circumstances of group responsibility for a punishable act, the punishment or blame that accrues to any one individual is often slight or nonexistent.\nFinally, if others are known to be present, but their behavior cannot be closely observed, any one bystander can assume that one of the other observers is already taking action to end the emergency. Therefore, his own intervention would be only redundant—perhaps harmfully or confusingly so. Thus, given the presence of other onlookers whose behavior cannot be observed, any given bystander can rationalize his own inaction by convincing himself that “somebody else must be doing something.”\n\n\nDraw your first (mini) VAST display for the definition of the concept “diffusion of responsibility” with draw.io (see concrete instructions below under “Deliverable”). As you noted, Darley and Latané provide no explicit section stating “Diffusion of responsibility is defined as …”. Therefore, you need to capture the essential elements of their definition yourself; do it precisely but also concisely in your VAST display.\nAfter you created your VAST display, read a more recent summary of the concept in the Dorsch Lexikon der Psychologie, in particular the first and the third (last) paragraph. Write a few sentences, elaborating to what extent this definition is compatible to your own VAST display, and where it deviates.\n\n\nDeliverable: For task 4B, save your draw.io VAST diagram in our Homework Repository by choosing “Github” as destination for your file:\n\nThen choose the Homework Repository:\n\n… and navigate to the correct homework folder:\n\nSave the diagram with your name as filename (homework/02-VAST/YOURNAME.drawio). Additionally, save the diagram as a .png or .jpg file in the same folder (homework/02-VAST/YOURNAME.png).\nFor task 4C, save a file with your answers in the same folder (homework/02-VAST/YOURNAME.md). Don’t forget to push everything to the remote repo."

Hence, the explanatory target is (a) the “classical” bystander effect and (b) the reduction of the bystander effect in dangerous situations (i.e., the dangerousness of situation is a moderator of the bystander main effect).\nAt the same time we reduce the VAST display by cutting all elements that are not relevant for this specific explanation.\n\nWe cut the “Five-step process model”\nFrom the three potential processes we only keep diffusion of responsibility (and ignore pluralistic ignorance and evaluation apprehension).\n\n\nIn other words, we try to build a minimal model that explains our explanatory target.\nThe additional theoretical explanation can be found in Fischer et al., p. 520-521. These are the relevant paragraphs:\n\n“[…] the most noteworthy tendency in recent research is that the bystander effect often does not occur when the emergency is a dangerous one or when the bystanders are highly competent. The classic bystander research regarded present bystanders as”something negative,” which reduces the probability of prosocial intervention. On the basis of the review of the more recent literature, we suspect that this perspective is not always correct. Bystanders can act as a positive source of physical support in case a focal person is in the process of deciding whether to intervene in a critical situation (especially when they are perceived as competent bystanders). The present meta-analysis allows us to systematically examine the possibility of a non-inhibiting (non-negative) bystander effect. In the following, we further explore this theoretical idea. We explain why we expect that dangerous emergencies are associated with a reduced magnitude of the bystander effect.”\nIf one is to intervene in a dangerous emergency, one may have to fear negative physical consequences. A perpetrator may not only attack the victim but also the intervener. In that case, additional bystanders may provide support in defeating a potential perpetrator. […] To conclude, we expect that high-danger emergencies increase the focal bystander’s fear that he or she will be attacked or injured in case of intervention. However, if other bystanders are present, they are recognized as a source of physical support, which mitigates against the traditional bystander effect. Note that we do not expect a complete disappearance of the bystander effect in dangerous emergencies. Instead, we expect that it substantially declines because of the fact that many dangerous emergency situations can only be resolved by a group.\nThus, we expect that it is mainly increased danger to the focal bystander that reduces the bystander effect, but not increased danger to the victim (which can be completely distinct from danger of intervention). […] In other words, if bystanders experience increased danger to themselves in case of intervention, they look for other bystanders to help them to intervene (e,g,, to overpower a fierce perpetrator), which should finally reduce diffusion of responsibility and thus also attenuate the magnitude of the bystander effect (because bystanders acknowledge that they can only resolve the dangerous situation by cooperation in a group).\n\nDeliverable: Create a new draw.io VAST display with the extended and reduced theory. Push the file to the homework repository in the folder Bystander_effect."

One of the most common types of plots we will use is a line plot with multiple groups and eventually multiple facets, like this one:\n\n\n\nLine plot with multiple groups\n\n\nWith such a plot, we can visualize one focal parameter on the x-axis, selected levels of another parameter as colors, and one or two other parameters as sub-plots in the facets. This allows a visualization of a high-dimensional parameter space in a single plot.\nIf you are not familiar with ggplot2, please do a tutorial as homework. Here are three choices:\n\nThe Data Visualization using ggplot2 tutorial from Datanovia. Do at least the following chapters:\n\nChapter 1 (“Introduction to GGPlot2”)\nChapter 7 (“GGPlot Line Plot”)\nChapter 14 (“Combine Multiple GGPlots into a Figure”), but only up to section “Multiple panels figure using ggplot facet” (skip the following section “Combine multiple ggplots using ggarrange”)\n\nThe most comprehensive resource is the free online ggplot2 book.\n\nStart with installing all necessary packages (see Prerequisites).\nNext, read chapter 2 “First Steps”\nFinally, do Chapter 16 “Faceting”\n\nData visualization with R and ggplot2 is a quite condensed tutorial on ggplot2 that explains the different layers of a plot with code examples, but not much explaining text.\n\nWhen you are unsure, I recommend the first resource.\n\n\n3 Homework Bonus (individually)\nFor an interactive visualization of your simulation results, you can program a Shiny app in R. Shiny is a web application framework for R, you can find various example for Shiny apps at https://shinyapps.org or https://shiny.posit.co.\nAmbitious students can (optionally!) create a Shiny app that allows the user to change parameters of the model interactively and see the results in real-time. For learning Shiny, I recommend the official Shiny tutorial. Although I use various code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code), I recommend using RStudio because it has a deeply integrated support for building and testing Shiny apps."

References To Theory Are Not Theory\n(Note: While the following features of a scholarly article do not constitute a theory, they might be important in their own right)\n\n\nA manuscript that Robert Sutton edited had strong data, but all three reviewers emphasized that it had “weak theory” and “poorly motivated hypotheses.” The author responded to these concerns by writing a new introduction that added citations to many papers containing theory and many terms like “psycho-social theory,” “identity theory,” and “social comparison theory.”\nBut it still contained no discussion of what these theories were about and no discussion of the logical arguments why these theories led to the author’s predictions. The result was that this paper contained almost no theory, despite the author’s assertion that much had been added.\n\nSolution:\n\nAuthors need to explicate which concepts and causal arguments are adopted from cited sources and how they are linked to the theory being developed or tested.\n\n\n\nSutton, R.

Every act of self-control reduces the amount of willpower, so that one’s ability to inhibit or suppress the next unwanted impulse is diminished\nThe theory is said to explain the phenomenon of ego depletion: people perform worse on a task that requires self-control, right after having done something else that used this resource.\n\n\n\nAbridged from van Dongen et al. (2022).

Instead, three standalone studies shall be reviewed, investigating generalizability across the four UTOS dimensions.\nAs research units, an Olympic team support staff (n = 9; Rossiter et al., 2022), a professional male football team (n=23, Fowler et al., 2017) and master triathletes (n = 12, Stevens et al., 2018) were investigated. These samples were extremely small and relatively homogeneous, consisting mainly of men and an over-proportion of professional athletes. We have no evidence about the generalizabilkity across the units dimension.\nThe transmeridian flights are considered as treatments in this context. The sample from Rossiter et al. (2022) underwent a 24-h eastward travel over 8 time zones (Ireland- Japan), the sample from Fowler et al. (2017) experienced a 19-h eastward flight over 11 time zones (Australia-Brazil) and the sample from Stevens et al. (2018) an northeastward journey with a mean travel time of 22.6-h of which 11.5-h were spent flying (Australia-US). While these show some variation in treatment strength, they are homogeneous in the sense that no short flights were reported, and all were eastward journeys. The there is only weak evidence for generalizability across the treatment dimension.\n[Paragraph on outcomes omitted …]\nAs to the settings investigated, […] all participants were in some way part of a high stakes competition and within training camps during the study period, which is a very narrow and non-typical situation.\nIn conclusion, based on the review of three studies, we have only inconclusive evidence whether jet lag can be considered a robust phenomenon. However, it seems reasonable to assume that jet lag is vastly more robust, and that this contradiction might mainly arise from the small number of studies reviewed here.”"

If …\n\nyou have many studies,\nwhich are methodologically sound (i.e., valid),\nand show (at least in sum) a decisive statistical result into either direction (i.e., either for a difference, or for a null effect)\n\n\n\nAs a sidenote: Ideally, evidence is quantified with a statistical technique that also allows to measure evidence for the null hypothesis and that gives a continuous quantification of the strength of evidence. A Bayes factor provides both desiderata."

As we don’t know about the untested variations, the evidence principally cannot be very strong.\n(E): principally unknowable whether the result generalizes to other variations. We can only conclude that we cannot conclude anything about generalizability.\n(F): evidence is inconclusive. There are descriptive differences between variations, but they are small, and it is not clear if these differences are statistically significant and substantial."

Consider the ManyLabs2 study:\nThe identical experiment (except translation of materials) has been administered online in very diverse samples (at least diverse with respect to nationality and cultural background).\n\nHence, there was high variation in the U(nits) and the S(ettings) dimensions, but very low variation in the T(reatment) and O(utcome) dimension.\nNon-zero effects could be found with remarkably low variability across samples: “Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied” (quoted from the Abstract)."

Instead, three standalone studies shall be reviewed, investigating generalizability across the four UTOS dimensions.\nAs research units, an Olympic team support staff (n = 9; Rossiter et al., 2022), a professional male football team (n=23, Fowler et al., 2017) and master triathletes (n = 12, Stevens et al., 2018) were investigated. These samples were extremely small and relatively homogeneous, consisting mainly of men and an over-proportion of professional athletes. We have no evidence about the generalizabilkity across the units dimension.\nThe transmeridian flights are considered as treatments in this context. The sample from Rossiter et al. (2022) underwent a 24-h eastward travel over 8 time zones (Ireland- Japan), the sample from Fowler et al. (2017) experienced a 19-h eastward flight over 11 time zones (Australia-Brazil) and the sample from Stevens et al. (2018) an northeastward journey with a mean travel time of 22.6-h of which 11.5-h were spent flying (Australia-US). While these show some variation in treatment strength, they are homogeneous in the sense that no short flights were reported, and all were eastward journeys. The there is only weak evidence for generalizability across the treatment dimension.\n[Paragraph on outcomes omitted …]\nAs to the settings investigated, […] all participants were in some way part of a high stakes competition and within training camps during the study period, which is a very narrow and non-typical situation.\nIn conclusion, based on the review of three studies, we have only inconclusive evidence whether jet lag can be considered a robust phenomenon. However, it seems reasonable to assume that jet lag is vastly more robust, and that this contradiction might mainly arise from the small number of studies reviewed here.”"
