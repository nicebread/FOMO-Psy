## The Jingle-Jangle Problem

> "Almost a century ago, it was remarked by a Professor Aikins that the science of psychology frequently manifests what he called 'the [jingle]{.hl} fallacy,' a circumstance wherein two things that are quite different may be labeled equivalently, and thus the unwary may consider them interchangeable" (Block, 1995, p. 209)

## An Example for the Jingle Problem

- Autonomy$_1$: A cognitive vulnerability associated with depression
  - ["... lacks the essential agentic core that would be necessary for an autonomy construct. [...] it is inconsistent with conceptualizations of autonomy and in need of a label more consistent with its nature"]{.smaller}
- Autonomy$_2$: Self (*auto*) – governance (*nomous*)
- Autonomy$_3$: Emphasis on interpersonal separation

- "Given the long history of research on conscientiousness and the better measures of it (compared to scales frequently used to measure grit) we believe that it would be better to ...
  - stop measuring grit with the Grit-S questionnaire
  - stop examining grit and rather continue to explore conscientiousness." (paraphrased from Ponnock et al., 2020)

## The Jingle-Jangle Problem

These jingle and jangle fallacies waste scientific time: 

- Jingle creates confusion and unncessary dispute ("No, the true meaning of autonomy is ...").
- Jangle involves useless redundancies, that lead to the ...
  - reinvention of constructs under new labels
  - decades of parallel literatures
  - (To what extent) are two theories actually the same theory? 
- &rarr; both slow down cumulative knowledge.

**Phenomena**: Stable and general features of the world in need of explanation. Can be understood as robust generalizations of patterns in empirical data. They are the explanatory targets for scientific theories. In psychology often called "effects" or "findings".

**Data**: Relatively direct observations. Refer to *particular* empirical patterns in concrete data sets rather than empirical generalizations (which would be phenomenona).

To claim a (robust) phenomenon, you ideally need:

- Independent replications with the *same* operationalizations (U, maybe S is varied): Often called "direct", "exact", or "close" replications
- Replications with *different* operationalizations (UTOS is varied): Often called "conceptual" replications

## Interlude: The risky shift phenomenon 1

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The risky shift phenomenon**: A group's decisions are riskier than the average of the individual decisions of members before the group met (i.e., the group discussion made individuals riskier).

::: {.incremental}
- Area of very active research in social psychology in the 1960s.
- "It could be easily replicated. Most of the replication studies [...] employed the CDQ [Choice Dilemma Questionnaire] as their stimulus set, and they generally had no trouble obtaining the basic risky shift result."
- **Today we know that there is no risky shift.** "It is now clear that the items contained in the original CDQ are in no sense a representative sample of the universe of all possible items. Instruments similar to the CDQ could readily be constructed whose scores would display risky shifts, cautious ones, or none at all" (Cartwright, 1971, p. 368).
- In the early risky shift literature, theoretical progress was unnecessarily impeded by multiple generations of replication studies (*k* ⋍ 200), nearly all relying on the same CQD questionnaire.

## Interlude: The risky shift phenomenon 2

**{{< fa people-group size=2x >}} Questions for discussion (10 min.):**

- Analyse the situation in the UTOS dimensions (units, treatments, outcomes, settings): To which dimensions did the successful replications (not) refer to?
- Is the "risky shift" finding - as demonstrated in the early publications - a *phenomenon*?

. . . 

*My take*: It *is* a phenomenon (though a weak one), as it generalizes to new units (i.e., new participants) of the same operationalization. But the generalizability was much weaker than initially expected. It is a phenomenon of this specific stimulus set (*outcome operationalization*) and suggests certain types of research questions (e.g., "What is so specific to this stimulus set?").



## Replication crisis
### Focus on phenomena

flowchart LR
  P(Phenomena)
  D(Data)
  
  P -- "Prediction" --> D
  D -- "Generalization" --> P
```

The concerns of the replication crisis typically referred to the relation between *data* and *phenomena*:

- Does an empirical pattern even *exist*? (Or is it a false positive?)
- If we found a reproducible pattern with a specific operationalization: Is it *generalizable* (to other measures, other cultural contexts, other samples)?
- [Do we even have a phenomenon in a particular research line?]{.hl} And how strongly should we belief in the existence of a phenomenon, given the empirical evidence?

> "We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. [...] A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models."

> "Many of these proposals [i.e., method reforms] are helpful ideas for raising the standards of good research practice, primarily ensuring more trustworthy inferences on the empirical level of scientific inference — the level connecting observations to empirical generalizations. Our concern is that shoring up the strength of inferences on the empirical level does not by itself address deficits on the theory level — the level connecting empirical generalizations to theories."

# Summary and Outlook

## Summary: Challenges to building useful theories in psychology

::: {.incremental}
- **Problems of theoretical precision** of psychological constructs (jingle-jangle)
- Relative **lack of robust phenomena** that impose constraints on possible theories
- These two lead to problems of **validity of psychological constructs** (i.e., do they actually related to the real world?)
- **Obstacles to discovering causal relationships** between psychological variables
- Probably the most complex research object in the known universe ...
- ... and ridiculously small samples.

## Outlook: How we will try to make it better ...

- Learn to use the Visual Argument Structure Tool (VAST)
  - Clear labels, that denote a precise latent construct.
  - A consensus about the meaning of words helps to communicate within and beyond the scientific community.
  - Conceptual precision increases its ability to be criticized
- Learn how to formalize verbal theories
  - Mathematical models
  - Agent-based models (ABMs)
- Simulate the models: Are they able to produce the phenomena we observe in the data?
- Practice with your own theory

Of course we can play the mathematician's game (and might have a lot of fun meanwhile). But ultimately, if we want to understand and explain the human psyche, we need to make sure that our constructs are grounded in reality.
