## Where do theories come from?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width='70%'}
- Falsificationism starts with a (tentative) theory, which is repeatedly tested, refuted, and refined.
- But where does the initial theory come from? "Flair"? Flash of inspiration in the shower?
- Popper did not care much about the first stage of creating theories - just about the later testing of theories.


**Conjecture**: We have a refined methodology¹ to *test* theories (e.g., experimental designs, statistical methods, preregistration, ...). [But we had (so far) no good methodology for constructing theories.]{.hl}

## Introduction

This is a brief introduction into some of the core features of VAST.
In doing this, I will simplify a few features and ignore others completely.

::: {.svg-h100 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
    layout=neato;
    X [shape=box, label="X", pos="0,0!"];
    Y [shape=box, label="Y", pos="2, 0!"];
    X -> Y [label="p"];
}
```
:::


## Types of elements (selection)
![](img/VAST_elements.png)


## Arrows stand for IF-THEN relationships
### If X, THEN Y

::: {.svg-h50 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato;
  X [shape=box, label="X", pos="0,0!"];
  Y [shape=box, label="Y", pos="2, 0!"];
  X -> Y;
}
```
:::

Six types of relationships:

- naming (**n**)
- conceptual implication (**i**)
- causation (**c**)
- prediction (**p**)
- transformation (**t**)
- reasoning (**r**)


## Naming concepts


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
::: {.svg-w400 .svg-h200 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato;
  I [shape=box, label="I", pos="0, 0!"];
  I_n [shape=box, label="\"Intelligent\"",pos="2,0!"];
  I -> I_n [label="n"];
}  
```
:::
:::

::: {.column width='50%'}
::: {.svg-w400 .svg-h200 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato;
  I [shape=box, label="I", pos="0, 0!"];
  I_n [shape=box, label="\"For example, this entire\nsentence here may also\nbe used as a name\nin a VAST display\"", pos="2,0!"];
  I -> I_n [label="n"];
}  
```
:::
:::
::::


- The `I` in the box symbolizes a **concept** 
  - A concept is an idea about a condition that may or may not apply to certain objects (e.g., people)
  - The **labels** of concepts (i.e., `I`) are abstract and basically arbitrary  
- The `n` stands for a naming relationship
- A **name** is a word (or sentence, or paragraph) that is used to describe those objects to which a concept applies. Names (or "labels") are set in quotation marks `""` in VAST displays.



## Naming concepts
### Synonyms

::: {.svg-h300 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato;
  I [shape=box, label="I", pos="0, 1!"];
  I_n [shape=box, label="\"Intelligent\"", pos="2,0!"];
  B_n [shape=box, label="\"Bright\"", pos="2,1!"];
  S_n [shape=box, label="\"Smart\"", pos="2,2!"];
  I -> I_n [label="n"];
  I -> B_n [label="n"];
  I -> S_n [label="n"];
}  
```
:::

A concept may have any number of names. Here, all three names are synonyms regarding concept `I`.




## Naming concepts
### Homonyms

::: {.svg-h300 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato;
  F [shape=box, label="F", pos="0, 0!"];
  T [shape=box, label="T", pos="0, 2!"];
  B_n [shape=box, label="\"Big\"", pos="2,1!"];
  F -> B_n [label="n"];
  T -> B_n [label="n"];
}
```
:::

This expresses the idea that the same name is used for conditions that may not be the same.
This name might thus be a **homonym.**



## Naming concepts
### Visualizing a jingle-jangle situation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='60%'}
::: {.svg-w400 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  // Use neato layout engine to allow manual positioning
  layout=neato;

  // Nodes with manually assigned positions
  F [label="F", shape=box, pos="0,2!"];
  T [label="T", shape=box, pos="0,0!"];
  F_n [label="\"Famous\"", shape=box, pos="2,3!"];
  B_n [label="\"Big\"", shape=box, pos="2,1!"];
  T_n [label="\"Tall\"", shape=box, pos="2,-1!"];
  
  // Edges with labels and arrowheads
  F -> F_n [label="n"];
  F -> B_n [label="n"];
  T -> B_n [label="n"];
  T -> T_n [label="n"];
}

```
:::
:::

::: {.column width='40%'}
- "Big" = jingle for `F` and `T`
- "Big" and "Famous" = jangle for `F`
:::

## Data

::: {.svg-h300 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
  layout=neato;
  T [shape=folder, label="T", pos="0, 1!"];
  I_n [shape=box, label="\"Intelligent\"", pos="2,0!"];
  H_n [shape=box, label="\"High Test Score\"", pos="2,2!"];
  T -> I_n [label="n"];
  T -> H_n [label="n"];
}  
```
:::


- **Data** (left box, folder-shaped) is a special kind of concept, which explicitly refers to something observable. 
  - Same as a manifest variable in Structural Equation Modeling 
- This display is supposed to capture the idea that "Intelligence is what the intelligence test measures"

## Data
### Symbol

Note: In the original VAST paper, the Data concept has a different shape (but that shape is not available in the Graphviz system used to create the graphs in this presentation):

## Data

::: {.svg-h400 style="text-align: center;"}

```{dot}
digraph G {
    layout=neato;
    
    HighScoreTest1 [label="\"High Score\nin Test 1\"", pos="0,0!", shape=box];

    T2 -> I [label="r "];             
    I -> Intelligent [label="n"];    
}

```
:::

- The `r` denotes *reasoning* relationships
- This display is supposed to capture the idea that more than one test may be used as evidence for people‘s intelligence




## Data
::: {.svg-h400 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
    // Use neato layout engine to allow manual positioning

    I -> T1 [label="c "];               // One-sided arrow from T1 to I
    I -> T2 [label="c"];               // One-sided arrow from T2 to I
    T1 -> T2 [label="p  ", dir="both"];  // Double-sided arrow between T1 and T2
    I -> Intelligent [label="n"];      // One-sided arrow from I to Intelligent
}

```
:::

- The `p` stands for a prediction 
- The `c` stands for causal effects



## Data
::: {.svg-h300 style="text-align: center;"}
```{dot}
digraph G {
    // Use neato layout engine to allow manual positioning
    layout=neato;
    
    // Nodes with explicit (x, y) positions
    HighScoreTest1 [label="\"High Score\nin Test 1\"", pos="0,0!", shape=box];
    HighScoreTest2 [label="\"High Score\nin Test 2\"", pos="0,3!", shape=box];
    T1 [label="T1", shape=folder, pos="0,1!"];
    T2 [label="T2", shape=folder, pos="0,2!"];
    I [label="I", shape=box, pos="2,1.5!"];
    Intelligent [label="\"Intelligent\"", pos="4,1.5!", shape=box];
    
    // Define edges with one-sided arrows
    T1 -> HighScoreTest1 [xlabel="n  "];  // One-sided arrow from HighScoreTest1 to T1
    T2 -> HighScoreTest2 [label="n  "];  // One-sided arrow from HighScoreTest2 to T2
    I -> T1 [label="c "];               // One-sided arrow from T1 to I
    I -> T2 [label="c"];               // One-sided arrow from T2 to I
    T1 -> T2 [label="p  ", dir="both"];  // Double-sided arrow between T1 and T2
    I -> Intelligent [label="n"];      // One-sided arrow from I to Intelligent
}

```
:::

This display is supposed to capture the idea that ...

- The same thing has a causal effect on the outcomes of both tests 
- Therefore, the outcomes of the two tests correlate with one another

Readability may often be promoted by setting naming relationships aside.

## Strength of relationship

- [Default interpretation]{.hl} of a directional arrow `X` &rarr; `Y`: this relationship is considered *relevant* and *positive* (i.e., the more X the more Y)
- Relationship strength can be expressed with a number between -1 (perfect negative relationship), 0 (no relationship), and 1 (perfect positive relationship)
  - If no number is explicitly specified: default relationship strength is "> 0"
- The strength of a relationship can also be expressed in a vague verbal way, e.g., "strong", "weak", "negative", ...
- The relationship strength can be applied to any relationship type:
  - type `p`: "wearing glasses" makes it 70 percent likely for a person to also be "smart"
  - type `r`: It is 90 percent reasonable to assume someone "is in love with you" when that person "giggles a lot while talking to you"
  - type `c`: being "obese" makes it 50 percent likely for someone to develop "Diabetes Type II" as a consequence

## Fuzziness as a feature

- The goal are *precise* theories - but in reality, they often are (at least partially) vague and fuzzy
- VAST allows to make this fuzziness explicit by allowing vague quantifiers of relationship strength, e.g. "weakly positive", "strong", ">0.5"
  - Better than assigning an arbitrary, pseudo-precise number
  - It's about formalizing the current state/precision of a verbal theory - if it is imprecise, let's show it!
- Show gaps, underspecifications, and inconsistencies in the theory


## Notes on the different types of relationships

- Relationships between constructs can be ...
	- on a theoretical level. Then it's typically a causal path (`c`)
	- on empirical level: A relationship has been found! This is a prediction path (`p`)
	- Research cycle: One author's exploratory `p`-path is the next author's theoretical `c`-path
- Consider what you want to formalize:
  - A certain author's theoretical point of view at a certain point in time?
  - Or your personal, current point of view?
  - The empirical support for a statement?

(A): "Mira is assumes that she has presented Robert's and Ayse's views correctly (with strength > 0.5, which is the default for IS and OUGHT elements). This implies that these two have different and incompatible statements about the single causal effect on `I`.

(B): Mira says (normatively) that Robert and Ayse should get along well.

(C): Mira is certain (relationship strength = `-1`) that the big box below (i.e., the incompatible views) causally leads to Robert and Ayse not getting along well.
