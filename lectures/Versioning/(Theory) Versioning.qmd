## Research Transparency - for theories?

> „Crucially, scientific models are expressed in unambiguous language such that **anyone can interpret the model and its claims about the world**. Contrary to mental models (which live in a person’s mind), scientific models are **transparent and public** (that is, external) representations.”

## Open Theorizing

- Fair access to knowledge: Who has access to the experts with the secret knowledge (who are able to explain/interpret their theory)?
- Reproducibility: Which version of a theory was gültig at a specific point in time?
- Falsifiability: When parts of the theory (the "miracles") are only private knowledge of the theory gurus, they are not falsifiable


## How to make a theory open and reproducible

TODO Glöckner

- Make it versioned (--> semantic versioning)
- Put an open license on it
