## Overview

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Instructor notes"}
- Bring empty name tags and board markers.
- During the Git intro, create the course's private homework repo. Create the folder `homework/01-Smaldino-chapter`.
- Create an R-project file (without that, `git` does not work in R-Studio). Otherwise, many students will create that project fiel themselves, leading to many merge conflicts.
- At the end, collect the name tags (and bring them along next time)

## Homework 1 (individually)

**Learning Goals**: Learn how to `pull`, `commit`, and `push` to Github. Be able to resolve a merge conflict.

**Homework steps**:

1. Create a Github account. (Skip if you have one already).
2. Send your Github user name to me via email. I will give you access to the course's private *Homework Repository*: [{{< var homework_repo >}}]({{< var homework_repo >}}). (Note: You won't be able to access, clone, or even see the repository until the lecturer has granted you access).

If you are proficient in `git` and Github, you can skip step 3:

3. Do the tutorial ["Introduction to version Control with git and GitHub within RStudio"](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/), **and** the follow-up tutorial "[Collaborative coding with GitHub and RStudio](https://lmu-osc.github.io/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/)". Depending on your prior knowledge, completing both tutorials will take between 30 min. and 2.5h.
    - Note: In chapter "Secure the connection ..." it says "You will then be asked to provide a passphrase. Protecting your keys with a password is optional but highly recommended". I recommend *not* to set a passphrase (just leave it empty), unless you deal with very sensitive data. You will get crazy if you need to enter your passphrase at every SSH operation.
4. Once you have been granted access to the [Homework Repository]({{< var homework_repo >}}), `clone` the repository to your local machine. (This cannot be done on an iPad or smartphone; you need a computer for that.). **Important**: Do *not* fork the repository (as you did in the tutorial), but *clone* it (i.e., we are all working within the same repository, not on individual forked copies of it).

**Deliverable**: 

Push your answer from Homework 2 (see below) to the folder `homework/01-Smaldino-chapter` of the remote repository (i.e., first save your file locally in the respective folder, then `commit` and `push`).

## Homework 2 (individually)

Download [Chapter 1](https://pup-assets.imgix.net/onix/images/9780691224145/9780691224138.pdf) of Paul Smaldino's Book "Modeling Social Behavior: Mathematical and Agent-Based Models of Social Dynamics and Cultural Evolution". Read the chapter and answer the following guiding questions:

1. A typical criticism of formal models is: "You baked your results into the model, so the conclusions are trivial". What could you answer to such a statement?

<!-- Answer: Yes, the conclusions follow directly from the assumptions - to that extent, the criticism has a true core. But that does not diminish the usefulness of formal models: Often the conclusions don't trivialy follow from the assumptions; humans are not good in directly inferring conclusions from, say, non-linear or complex models. Models allow to check, whether our assumptions *actually* lead to the phenomena that should be explained. -->

2. What is done in a "decomposition"?

<!-- Answer: A decomposition gives answers to the following questions: What are the parts of the system we are interested in? What are their properties? What are the relationships between the parts and their properties? How do those properties and relationships change?  -->

3. What question should guide the decomposition?

<!-- Answer: How you decompose a system depends on the questions you are trying to answer with your model and on the granularity required for answers to those questions. It is the question that determines the relevant parts of the system! -->

4. What is, according to Smaldino, the key difference between *exact* and *inexact* sciences?

<!-- Answer: In the exact sciences, theories involve direct mappings between measurable constructs and model predictionsâ€” the terms in their fundamental equations all have universally-accepted units.
The inexact sciences are those in which the mappings between measurements and theo- ries are imprecise. -->

5. Name the two types of models that typically are employed in social sciences.

<!-- Answer: Equation-based models and agent-based models -->

**Deliverable**: Submit answers to the guiding questions as a plain text or markdown file to the course's [Homework Repository]({{< var homework_repo >}}):

- Navigate to `/homework/01-Smaldino-chapter` (After you cloned the repository in Homework 1, you should have that folder somewhere on your local machine.)
- Add your answers as `.txt` or `.md` file with your first name as filename (e.g., "`Heinz-Ruediger.md`")
- `commit` and `push`
- (To verify your submission: Go to the [website]({{< var homework_repo >}}) of the repository, and check whether your file is in the folder `homework/01-Smaldino-chapter`.)

You can answer in English or in German. Most questions can be easily answered in one sentence. Feel free to copy and paste the relevant sentences from the paper. If you are tempted to use ChatGPT, better don't do the homework at all (after all, the goal of this exercise is that you *learn* something, not that you make your lecturer happy).

Using `git` for the first time can be challenging. But it's a skill that will pay off in the long run. If you get stuck, and made honest attempts to solve the problems yourself, don't get desperate: Just send me your homework via email, and we will sort it out together in the next session.
