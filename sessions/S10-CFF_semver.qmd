# Tasks for today

1. Create your `CITATION.cff` file, assign your first version number (presumably: `0.1.0`). Push it to the repository.
2. Aim to finish steps 1-5 of the [Formalization Steps](../Formalization_steps.qmd)
   - For Step 4 ("Collect robust phenomena"), write a short paragraph that summarizes your evaluation of the robustness of the phenomenon. (This will be needed for the final report).
3. Start working on Step 6 ("Create your VAST display")

# Homework due *next week*, 24.1.2025 (in groups): Work on your group project

Finalize (at least) steps 1-7 of the [Formalization Steps](../Formalization_steps.qmd), so that you can start working on programming in the next session.

**Deliverable**: 

- Increase the version (e.g., to `0.2.0`) in the `CITATION.cff` file.
- Push your current version to the repository.
- Create a tag, give it the version name (e.g., `v0.2.0`) and write a short description for the release.
 
Do these steps regardless whether the theory object currently is in a "functional state" or still in a messy development version.
