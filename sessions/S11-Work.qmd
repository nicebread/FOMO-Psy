# Tasks for today

Work on steps on the remaining steps (8-11) of the [Formalization Steps](../Formalization_steps.qmd).
You probably won't finish all steps, but the more you achieve, the less you have to do for the final report.

Remember to restrict yourself: Aim for *few* phenomena (ideally, only one) and *simple* theories and models. It gets complicated all by itself!

**Deliverable**: 

- Increase the version (e.g., to `0.3.0`) in the `CITATION.cff` file.
- Push your current version to the repository.
- Create a tag, give it the version name (e.g., `v0.3.0`) and write a short description for the release.
 
Do these steps regardless whether the theory object currently is in a "functional state" or still in a messy development version.
