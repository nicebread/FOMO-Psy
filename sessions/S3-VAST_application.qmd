## Homework wrap-up: VAST displays for "diffusion of responsibility"

- 3-4 people present their VAST displays that they created as homework.

## Group formation

- Create a maximum of 4 groups. These will work together for the bystander formalization.
  - (Note: When their own theories are formalized later in the course, students can form new groups).
- Each group chooses a group name starting with the letters A, B, C, or D.

## Workshop (in course, as a group): Formalize the bystander effect theory

- Each group makes a copy of the template file "Bystander Modell: Construct Source Table Template" that you find on Google Drive. Add your group name/letter to the file name!
- Go through the steps 3-5 in the slides on ["Applying VAST to an existing theory"](../lectures/VAST/VAST_Application.qmd)
  - Step 1 ("Choose your starting point") is already decided: We use the "[A-B Mixture Model](../lectures/VAST/VAST_Application.qmd#a-b-mixture-model-for-formalization-attempts)"
  - Step 2 ("Limit your scope") is already decided (see the quotes in the template file).
- Step 3: Collect robust empirical phenomena: Skim the meta-analysis by Fischer et al. (2011, see [homework repository]({{< var homework_repo >}})) and make a judgement about the robustness of the bystander effect across the UTOS dimensions. Only do this briefly, you don't need to be exhaustive here.
- Step 4 ("Collect definitions of constructs"): Fill in the Construct Source Table 
- Step 5 ("Distill a working definition for each construct, add relationships"): Based on the table, create a VAST display in draw.io. This should contain:
  - Definitions for the relevant constructs (maybe as separat naming relationships)
  - In particular a definition of "diffusion of responsibility" (which we already tried in the last homework - now find a consensus definition as a group)
  - A formalization of the *theory* (i.e., the generative mechanisms that are supposed to explain the phenomenon). 
- The goal is an easily understandable display: Prioritize understandability over completeness and over a maximally truthful mapping of the original statements. 
  - Use as few concepts as possible (but as many as necessary).
  - Why aim for a simple model? Because we want to formalize the model mathematically in a second step, and we need a feasible model for that.
- Save the .drawio file on the [homework repository]({{< var homework_repo >}}) in the subfolder `Bystander_effect`. **Each group should create a subfolder within that folder, with your team name as folder name**.
  

*(Note: You won't finish all steps in class. You will finalize the tasks as homework.)*

## Homework (as a group): Finalize Bystander VAST

**Deliverables**: 

- Complete and clean up your Construct Source Table on Google Drive.
- Upload/commit your draw.io VAST display in the [Homework Repository]({{< var homework_repo >}}), subfolder `Bystander_effect`, with your team name as file name.
