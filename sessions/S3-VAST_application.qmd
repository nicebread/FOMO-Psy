# Workshop (in course): Formalize the bystander effect theory

1. Create the Construct Source Table for the Bystander Effect. Use the Google Drive template.
2. Based on the table, create a VAST display. The goal is an easily understandable display: prioritize understandability over completeness and over a maximally truthful mapping of the original statements. Use as few concepts as possible (but as many as necessary).
(Why aim for a simple model? Because we want to formalize the model mathematically in a second step, and we need a feasible model for that).



# Homework (as a group): Finalize Bystander VAST

**Deliverables**: 
- Clean up your Construct Source Table on Google Drive
- Upload/commit your draw.io VAST display in the [Homework Repository]({{< var homework_repo >}}), subfolder `Bystander_effect`.
