# Homework (individually)

For visualizing our simulation results in the next session, we will use the `ggplot2` package in `R`. One of the most common types of plots we will use is a line plot with multiple groups and eventually multiple facets, like this one:

![Line plot with multiple groups](img/ggplot2_example.png)

With such a plot, we can visualize one focal parameter on the x-axis, selected levels of another parameter as colors, and one or two other parameters as sub-plots in the facets. This allows a visualization of a high-dimensional parameter space in a single plot.

If you are not familiar with `ggplot2`, please do a tutorial as homework. Here are three choices:

- The [Data Visualization using ggplot2](https://www.datanovia.com/en/courses/data-visualization-using-ggplot2/) tutorial from Datanovia. Do at least the following chapters:
  - Chapter 1 ("[Introduction to GGPlot2](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/introduction-to-ggplot2/)")
  - Chapter 7 (["GGPlot Line Plot"](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/ggplot-line-plot/))
  - Chapter 14 (["Combine Multiple GGPlots into a Figure"](https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/combine-multiple-ggplots-into-a-figure/)), but only up to section "Multiple panels figure using ggplot facet" (skip the following section "Combine multiple ggplots using ggarrange")
- The most comprehensive resource is the free online [ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/).
  - Start with installing all necessary packages (see [Prerequisites](https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction#sec-prerequisites)).
  - Next, read chapter 2 ["First Steps"](https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started)
  - Finally, do Chapter 16 ["Faceting"](https://ggplot2-book.org/facet)
- [Data visualization with R and ggplot2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-visualization-with-r-and-ggplot2/) is a quite condensed tutorial on ggplot2 that explains the different layers of a plot with code examples, but not much explaining text.

When you are unsure, I recommend the first resource.

# Homework Bonus (individually)

For an interactive visualization of your simulation results, you can program a Shiny app in R. Shiny is a web application framework for R, you can find various example for Shiny apps at [https://shinyapps.org](https://shinyapps.org) or [https://shiny.posit.co](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/#user-showcase). 

Ambitious students can (optionally!) create a Shiny app that allows the user to change parameters of the model interactively and see the results in real-time. For learning Shiny, I recommend the official [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/).
Although I use various code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code), I recommend using RStudio because it has a deeply integrated support for building and testing Shiny apps.
