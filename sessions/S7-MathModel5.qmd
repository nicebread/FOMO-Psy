# Prototypical formalization styles:

**Narrative Theory Reconstruction (NTR)**: 

- *Starting point*: The existing verbal theory.
- *Main tasks*: Read and understand the narrative theory, then formalize it. Check whether a simulation can produce the target phenomenon.
- *Of only minor importance*: Whether the phenomenon is actually robust.

**Theory Construction Methodology (TCM)**: 

- *Starting point*: A robust phenomenon.
- *Main tasks*: 
  - Understand the phenomenon (its robustness, evidence, moderating conditions, operationalizations; search for meta-analyses). 
  - Invent a new theory that can explain the phenomenon, or use an established theory from another domain and make necessary adjustments (could be within psychology, but also from completely different disciplines).
  - Check whether a formal model of your theory produces the phenomenon. 
- *Of only minor importance*: Any existing theory that aims to explain the phenomenon. You might compare your own formal model to existing theories later.

# Homework (individually)

Think about which theory you want to work on: Either one of the two suggested theories, or propose another one. Next week we will form groups.

Think about:

- Scope: Which aspect of the theory do you want to focus on?
- Target phenomenon
- Which formalization style?
