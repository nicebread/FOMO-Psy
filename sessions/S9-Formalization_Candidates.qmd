## Prepare your own repository

Each group should set up their technical infrastructure - from now on, you start working in your own repository.

1. Create a fresh Github repository *and* a folder on Google Drive (or a comparable collaborative document) for the tables.
2. Link the latter in the README of the repository.
3. Invite the lecturer (user name: `nicebread`) as a collaborator: {{<fa gear>}} Settings → {{<fa user-group>}} Collaborators → "Add people"
