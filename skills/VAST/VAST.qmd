## Fuzziness

- The goal are *precise* theories - but in reality, they are (partially) vague and fuzzy
- VAST allows to make this fuzziness explicit by allowing vague quantifiers of relationship strength, e.g. "weakly positive", "strong"
  - Better than assigning an arbitrary, pseudo-accurat number
  - It's about formalizing the current state/precision of a verbal theory - if it is imprecise, let's show it!
