## What constitutes a good theory?

1. Inherent quality criteria

::: {.callout-note}
# „experimental tests are often superfluous and we should instead focus more on nonempirical evaluations of the quality of our theories" (Szollosi & Donkin, 2021)
:::

2. Empirical evidence for the theory ("Empirische Bewährung"), usually expressed as *relative* evidence compared to a competing theory.

## Inherent quality criteria

A good theory ...

- defines the variables
- specifies the domain
- builds internally consistent relationships
- makes specific predictions about phenomena that have not yet been observed (only specific predictions, which can also be false, allow falsifications)

# A good theory is falsifiable?

Very difficult topic ...
- Quine-Duhem problem: A failed test always can either be attributed to (a) a core hypothesis (which would falsify / weaken the theory) or (b) an auxiliary hypothesis ("The manipulation did not work; the measurement was unreliable")
- Lakatosian defense (blaming the auxiliary, creating new ad-hoc auxiliary hypotheses)
